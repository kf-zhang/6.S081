* Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
    a2
* Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
    ```assemble
        li a1,12
    ```
    Since f(8)+1 is constant, the compiler direct calcualte it
* At what address is the function printf located?
    0x628
* What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
    0x38
